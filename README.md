Recently, I was the introduced to this whole journey an all began with a SSG I created called TEST101. Before that, I was the another . around.

As a former Graphic Designer, I'll always have a soft spot for design. The space between development and design is where I thrive. Now focusing in using and learning to adapt those changes 

I have a strong passion to create. Passionate about using the environment and design to move society towards a more sustainable future. I lust to learn and for a new challenge that really pushes my skills to the test so that I can continue to grow.
